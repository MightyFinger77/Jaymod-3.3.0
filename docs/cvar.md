# Jaymod 3.1.0 cvar list

Server cvars for **Jaymod 3.1.0**. Values in the **jaymod.cfg** column are from the bundled sample (`dist/jaymod.cfg`, also in the zip). Put `exec jaymod.cfg` in `server.cfg`. qagame does not write this file.

Engine default is listed when it differs from the sample. Empty string is `""`. Bitflags are sums of the listed bits.

Original XML pages for classic cvars are under `doc/cvar/`. Lua details: [lua.md](lua.md). Map vote: [server.md](server.md#map-voting).

## Added in 3.0.0

Lua host and 64-bit Omni-bot. Not in the classic sample cfg.

| Cvar | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lua_modules` | `""` | Space-separated Lua scripts to load from the mod folder, `luascripts/`, or `lua/`. Empty = Lua stays idle. |
| `lua_allowedModules` | `""` | If set, only scripts whose SHA1 hex appears in this string are loaded. Empty = allow all. |
| `lua_reportWebhook` | `""` | Optional HTTP URL for scripts. Do not put secrets in `jaymod.cfg`; keep tokens in a file the script reads. |
| `omnibot_enable` | `1` | Load Omni-bot. Use ETL’s 64-bit `omnibot_et_x64.dll`, not 32-bit `omnibot_et.dll`. |
| `omnibot_path` | `""` | Folder that contains `omnibot_et_x64.dll`, `et/`, and `global_scripts/`. |
| `omnibot_flags` | `0` | Omni-bot option flags. |
| `omnibot_playing` | `0` | Read-only count of bots in serverinfo. |

```
set lua_modules ""
set lua_allowedModules ""
set omnibot_enable "1"
set omnibot_path "C:/path/to/omni-bot"
```

Console: `lua_status`, `lua_restart`.

## Added in 3.1.0

EnhMod-in-qagame, Nitmod-style map vote, widescreen HUD.

### Map voting (`g_gametype 6`)

Keep gametype 6 on every map in the cycle. `g_xpSave` still works.

| Cvar | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `g_gametype` | sample `2`, engine `4` | `2` objective, `3` stopwatch, `4` campaign, `5` LMS, **`6` map vote**. |
| `g_maxMapsVotedFor` | `0` | How many maps on the intermission list. `0` = every map that is not excluded (max 96), including the map just played. |
| `g_minMapAge` | `3` | Hide maps played this many maps ago. Ignored when `g_maxMapsVotedFor` is `0`. |
| `g_excludedMaps` | `:oasis:goldrush:radar:railgun:fueldump:` | Colon-separated bsp names to hide. Add `:battery:` to hide Battery too. |
| `g_mapVoteFlags` | `20` | `1` least-played wins ties, `2` wait until `g_intermissionReadyPercent` have voted, `4` three ranked votes (3/2/1), `8` do not shuffle, `16` `!nextmap` / callvote nextmap stay on the vote screen. Default `20` is `4+16`. Ranked votes are always on in 3.1.0. |

```
set g_gametype 6
set g_excludedMaps ":oasis:goldrush:radar:railgun:fueldump:"
set g_maxMapsVotedFor "0"
set g_minMapAge "3"
set g_mapVoteFlags "20"
```

### EnhMod (published 1.0.9d names)

| Cvar | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `g_em_votemap` | `0` | `1` limits callvote to `map`, `nextmap`, `maprestart`, and `campaign`. |
| `g_adrenenalinecls` | `2` | Published spelling. Bits: `1` soldier, `2` medic, `4` engineer, `8` fieldops, `16` covert. Default `2` = medics. |
| `g_drawAttackerHP` | `0` | Show last attacker HP: `1` console, `2` on-screen CPM. |
| `g_countryflags` | `0` | `1` writes country id into userinfo when `GeoLite2-City.mmdb`, `GeoLite2-Country.mmdb`, or legacy `GeoIP.dat` is next to `qagame`. |
| `g_flagsbehaviour` | `""` | `random` = random bot flag. Otherwise treated as an IP to look up for bots. |
| `g_rifleWar` | `0` | Rifle-only spawn (`!riflewar`). |
| `g_pistolWar` | `0` | Pistol-only spawn (`!pistolwar`). |
| `g_pumpgunWar` | `0` | M97-only spawn (`!pumpgunwar`). |

Spawn / ammo / antirush live in `ModEnhConfig.xml` and `enhmod_*.db`, not cvars. `modifieddoublejump` in XML turns on `g_misc` bit `1`.

### Client (3.1.0)

| Cvar | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `jay_fixedAspect` | `1` | `1` or unset = widescreen HUD/UI without stretch. `0` = old stretched 640×480. ETL’s archived `cg_fixedAspect 0` is ignored. |

## Added in 2.3.0 (RNGesus)

Still used in 3.1.0. Most are not in the classic sample cfg.

| Cvar | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `g_requireClientVersion` | `0` | `1` rejects clients whose Jaymod version does not match. Keep `0` if older pk3s are still in the wild. |
| `g_dbAutoSave` | `300` | Seconds between automatic Admin DB saves. `0` disables. |
| `g_aimSpreadTurnScale` | `1.0` | Scales turn spread. `1.0` is the frame-rate-independent amount. |
| `g_hitmodeAntilagInterp` | `0` | Shifts antilag reconciliation back by this many ms. |
| `g_playerCount` | `0` | Read-only Axis + Allied player count for map scripts. |
| `g_panzerMapLimit` | `0` | Caps consecutive maps one player can hold a panzer. |
| `g_debugBullets` | `0` | Dev-only bullet path overlay (cheats / `devmap`). |
| `cg_cycleBinoculars` | `0` | Client. `0` skips binoculars when cycling weapons. |

`cg_noVoiceChats` is a bit field as of 2.3.0: `0` all, `1` none, `3` team/fireteam only.
