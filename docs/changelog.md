# Changelog

Lineage: official **Jaymod 2.2.0** (Jaybird, 2011) → **2.3.0** (RNGesus, 2026) → **3.0.0** (was 2.3.1: Lua + 64-bit ET: Legacy).

## 3.0.0

Formerly numbered **2.3.1**. Server reports version **3.0.0**. Client modules in the pk3 are 2.3.0 assets plus 64-bit `cgame`/`ui` and `jaymod-3.0.0.dat`. Keep `g_requireClientVersion 0` if players still run an older Jaymod pk3. The zip includes a sample `jaymod.cfg` (Lua / Omni-bot cvars). Put `exec jaymod.cfg` in `server.cfg`.

### Lua

- Vendored Lua 5.1 in `qagame`
- `lua_modules`, `lua_allowedModules`
- ET: Legacy–style callbacks (`et_InitGame`, `et_ClientCommand`, …) and `et.*` functions
- `et.httpRequest` on Windows (WinHTTP) for HTTP admin tools
- Console: `lua_status`, `lua_restart`

See [Lua](lua.md).

### 64-bit ET: Legacy

- CMake builds `qagame_mp_x64.dll`, `cgame_mp_x64.dll`, `ui_mp_x64.dll` (and `*_x86_64` copies)
- `vmMain` / `dllEntry` / engine syscalls use `intptr_t`
- `jaymod-3.0.0.pk3` ships **both** 32-bit and 64-bit client modules
- 32-bit `cgame_mp_x86.dll` / `ui_mp_x86.dll` are stamped **Jaymod 3.0.0** (the leftover 2.3.0 modules aborted in `CG_Init` on ET: Legacy 32-bit, unloaded cgame, then `STATUS_BAD_STACK`)
- `qagame` stays **outside** the pk3
- Omni-bot loader tries `omnibot_et_x64.dll` (Windows) and `omnibot_et.x86_64.so` (Linux) before the 32-bit names

See [server install](server.md) and [build](build.md).

### Known limits in 3.0.0

- Enhanced Mod (`jaymod_enh`) will not attach to this `qagame`
- Linux 64-bit *clients* need `.x86_64.so` modules (the Windows zip does not include those)
- Lua is a server-admin subset of the published Legacy API (no botlib / sound / shader registration)

## 2.3.0 (RNGesus)

Maintenance release. Bug fixes, not new weapons or modes. A lot of 2.2.0 counted frames where it should have counted milliseconds, so behavior silently depended on client FPS and `sv_fps`.

Source: [RngesusSolutions/jaymod2.2.0](https://github.com/RngesusSolutions/jaymod2.2.0). Precompiled zip: [jaymod-2.3.0.zip](https://github.com/RngesusSolutions/jaymod2.2.0/releases/download/2.3.0/jaymod-2.3.0.zip).

### Timing / frame-rate

- Weapon cooling keeps the fractional remainder between frames (high FPS no longer overheats early)
- STEN `maxHeat` 1200 → 1350 so a full burst is still 16 rounds after the cooling fix
- Recoil on a fixed 15 ms schedule
- Turn spread keeps fractional changes (`g_aimSpreadTurnScale`)
- Uniform stealing is 2.5 real seconds
- Flame chunks use real frame duration (`sv_fps` no longer changes range)
- `pmove_fixed` leaning crash fixed
- Fixed-movement clients no longer pile commands in antiwarp, inflate ping, or get false Connection Interrupted

### Shooting, movement, hits

- Crouched bullets and `+activate` traces start at real eye height
- Emplaced MG42 fire lines up with the crosshair
- Crouch-spam scripts are rate-limited
- Prone clearance keeps the traced leg offset
- Overkill XP only for health actually removed
- Dead players cannot shove; dead or feigning players cannot be shoved
- `cg_crosshairX` / `cg_crosshairY` are real screen pixels at any resolution
- `g_hitmodeAntilagInterp` offsets antilag reconciliation
- `g_debugBullets` draws real paths (devmap / cheats)

### Weapons and equipment

- Thrown knives stop bouncing after a while
- Satchel detonator checks the correct clip value
- Weapon cycling skips binoculars by default (`cg_cycleBinoculars 1` restores 2.2.0)
- `g_panzerMapLimit` rotates panzer access across maps
- Tank / emplaced-gun mounting is rate-limited
- “Insufficient fire support” spam is throttled
- Spotted landmines stay visible to engineer defuse traces
- Mines spotted in one batch share one announcement and score update

### Spectators, teams, scores

- Spectators keep their own score
- Players waiting to spawn can only follow their own team
- Limbo followers move when their target switches teams
- Scope FOV/reticle is cleared after following a scoped player
- A full `g_maxGameClients` only blocks a spectator *joining*; class/team change no longer dumps you to spec
- End-of-map XP awards use that map’s XP, not career totals
- Per-map revives and headshots reset properly
- Stale stats are not restored when a new stats period starts
- Leftover projectiles stop damaging after the owner disconnects

### Chat, voice, UI

- Ignore list covers voice chat
- `cg_noVoiceChats` is a bit field (`3` = team/fireteam only)
- Lagometer draws all 48 samples at every resolution
- Crosshair and no-shoot indicators share the pixel-accurate offset

### Server

- `g_dbAutoSave` — timed Admin DB save
- `g_requireClientVersion` — optional matching client pk3
- `g_playerCount` — live player count for map scripts
- Weapon-to-item lookups cached
- Command-map entity messages use fixed buffers
- Axis and Allied landmines counted in one pass
- Event-count overflow fails at build time

### `g_panzerMapLimit`

With `g_panzerMapLimit 3`, a player can take a panzer on three maps, then is locked out for the next three completed maps.

- A map counts only if the weapon was actually granted
- Voluntarily skipping before the limit resets the run
- Stored in `user.db` by GUID
- Lockout counts server-completed maps (spec / offline still count)
- `map_restart` does not advance
- Still applies with `team_maxPanzers -1` or `g_panzerWar 1`
- Players without a GUID are not tracked

### 2.3.0 cvars

| Cvar | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `g_requireClientVersion` | `0` | `1` kicks mismatched Jaymod client versions |
| `g_dbAutoSave` | `300` | Seconds between Admin DB saves; `0` off |
| `g_aimSpreadTurnScale` | `1.0` | Turn-spread scale (sent to clients) |
| `g_hitmodeAntilagInterp` | `0` | Extra ms of antilag rewind |
| `g_playerCount` | `0` | Read-only player count |
| `g_panzerMapLimit` | `0` | Consecutive-map panzer cap |
| `g_debugBullets` | `0` | Draw bullet paths (cheats) |
| `cg_cycleBinoculars` | `0` | `1` = old cycle-through-binocs |

## 2.2.0 (Jaybird)

Last official Jaymod. Admin, shrubbot, extra weapons (M97, molotov, poison, …), Jaymod HUD/UI, Omni-bot 0.8 interface. 32-bit ET 2.60b only.
